-------- @callgraph callgraph --------

Below is a call graph of the entire program.
The numbered nodes form a spanning tree.
Non-numbered nodes indicate back- or cross-edges to the node whose
 number follows in parentheses.
Some nodes may appear multiple times due to context-sensitive
 treatment of some calls.

0	<root>
1	    main.init
2	        reflect.init
3	    main.main
4	        main.f
