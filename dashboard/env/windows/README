Unlike the other operating systems which have a bash script that runs
on Linux and scripts qemu to prepare a GCE image, the Windows image
builder image is prepared by hand, following this list of
instructions:

-- in GCE, create a new Windows 2008 server instance. Set its initial username
   to "wingopher" and the password to something.

-- boot it. first boot is slow.

-- Connect with RDP to it. (I used the OS X Microsoft Remote Desktop
   in the Mac App Store)

-- In initial “Initial Configuration Tasks” window:
   * disable automatic installation of updates. They’ll just interrupt
     the builds later. And we don't care about security since this isn't
     going to be Internet-facing. No ports will be accessible
   * disable Windows Error Report (“Not participating”)

TODO: disable the Windows firewall too. might break some outgoing net
      tests? Figure out where to do this.

-- Enable auto-login:
   * Start > Run > Open: "control userpasswords2" [OK]
   * Uncheck the "Users must enter a user name..." box (it already was
     unchecked for me)
   * Press "OK"
   * Enter password twice.

-- Download winstrap.
   * Bring up cmd.exe (Start > Run > "cmd" [OK])
   * Copy/paste (Right click: paste) this into cmd.exe:

     bitsadmin /transfer mydownloadjob  /download /priority normal https://storage.googleapis.com/winstrap/winstrap-2015-01-03-440bb77.exe c:\users\wingopher\Desktop\winstrap.exe

   * It should appear on the desktop.

-- double click winstrap. type "go" and press <enter>. abort it once
   it's downloaded everything. (close the window)

-- make the Buildlet start on boot:
   * Start > All Programs > right click "Startup"
   * Right-mouse-drag "Start Buildlet" from the desktop (from winstrap) to the
     Startup folder and "Create shortcuts here"

-- Install git with middle option: "Use Git from Windows Command Prompt",
   otherwise all the defaults.

-- click yes yes yes on the tdm64-gcc installer question defaults.
   Then do the tdm64-gcc installer again but do 32-bit this time. You
   should then have two TDM installs at c:\TDM-GCC-64 and
   c:\TDM-GCC-32.  Don’t pick other locations. The gobuilder adds
   those to your path.

TODO(bradfitz): this document is incomplete. Cover gcesysprep,
regedit(?), windows-startup-script-cmd, etc.  And I think winstrap
will need to write things to something outside of C:\Users, since
sysprep on reboot nukes all users, at least on GCE. We probably need
to run the buildlet's stage0 from the windows-startup-script-cmd. Find
& ask Windows experts.
