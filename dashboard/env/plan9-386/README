make.bash creates a Google Compute Engine VM image to run the Go
Plan 9 builder, booting up to run the buildlet.

make.bash should be run on a Linux box with qemu.

After it completes, it creates a file plan9-386-gce.tar.gz

The make.bash script depends on the following packages:

$ sudo apt-get install bzip2 curl expect qemu
or
$ sudo yum install bzip2 curl expect qemu

It has been tested with QEMU 1.4.2 to 2.2.0, as provided with:

 - Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty Tahr) and above
 - Debian 8.0 (Jessie) and above
 - Fedora 19 and above

Also, due to an ATA bug affecting QEMU 1.6 and 1.7, the
Plan 9 CD can't be booted with these versions.
