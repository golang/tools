# We need more modern libc than Debian stable as used in base, so we're
# using Ubuntu LTS here.

# TODO(bradfitz): make both be Ubuntu? But we also want Debian, Fedora, 
# etc coverage., so deal with unifying these later, once there's a plan
# or a generator for them and the other builders are turned down.
