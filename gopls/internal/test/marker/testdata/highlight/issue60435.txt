This is a regression test for issue 60435:
Highlighting "net/http" shouldn't have any effect
on an import path that contains it as a substring,
such as httptest.

-- highlights.go --
package highlights

import (
	"net/http"          //@hiloc(httpImp, `"net/http"`, text)
	"net/http/httptest" //@hiloc(httptestImp, `"net/http/httptest"`, text)
)

var _ = httptest.NewRequest
var _ = http.NewRequest //@hiloc(here, "http", text), highlight(here, here, httpImp)
