This is a regression test for bug #63592 in "organize imports" whereby
the new imports would shadow predeclared names.

In the original example, the conflict was between predeclared error
type and the unfortunately named package github.com/coreos/etcd/error,
but this example uses a package with the ludicrous name of complex128.

The new behavior is that we will not attempt to import packages
that shadow predeclared names. (Ideally we would do that only if
the predeclared name is actually referenced in the file, which
complex128 happens to be in this example, but that's a trickier
analysis than the internal/imports package is game for.)

The name complex127 works as usual.

	var _ complex128 = 1 + 2i
