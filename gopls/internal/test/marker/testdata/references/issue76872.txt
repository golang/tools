This test exercises a references query at a position where an empty selection
might be considered enclosed both by the node before (Ident) and the node after
(FuncType). It ensures that we find the reference of the syntax node before the
cursor.

See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/76872.

-- main.go --
package main

// re"foo()" matches the zero-width position after "foo", not the call parens.
func foo() {} //@ loc(decl, "foo"), refs(re"foo()", decl, call)

func _() {
	foo() //@ loc(call, "foo")
}
