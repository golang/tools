This test verifies two types of errors when generating interface method stubs:
1. adding method __ would conflict with (or shadow) existing field
2. method __ already exists but has the wrong type

type I interface {
	Foo()
	Bar()
}

type B struct {

type A struct {}

func (a *A) Foo() {}
func (b *B) Foo(bool) {} // method Foo exists on B but has the wrong type

var _ I = (*B)(nil) //@quickfixerr(re"..B..nil.", re"missing method", "already exists but has the wrong type")
