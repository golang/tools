# Gopls: Analyzers

<!-- No Table of Contents: GitHub's Markdown renderer synthesizes it. -->

Gopls contains a driver for pluggable, modular static
[analyzers](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis#hdr-Analyzer),
such as those used by [go vet](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet).

Most analyzers report mistakes in your code;
some suggest "quick fixes" that can be directly applied in your editor.
Every time you edit your code, gopls re-runs its analyzers.
Analyzer diagnostics help you detect bugs sooner,
before you run your tests, or even before you save your files.

This document describes the suite of analyzers available in gopls,
which aggregates analyzers from a variety of sources:

- all the usual bug-finding analyzers from the `go vet` suite (e.g. `printf`; see [`go tool vet help`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet) for the complete list);
- a number of analyzers with more substantial dependencies that prevent them from being used in `go vet` (e.g. `nilness`);
- analyzers that augment compilation errors by suggesting quick fixes to common mistakes (e.g. `fillreturns`); and
- a handful of analyzers that suggest possible style improvements (e.g. `simplifyrange`).

To enable or disable analyzers, use the [analyses](settings.md#analyses) setting.

In addition, gopls includes the [`staticcheck` suite](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks).
When the [`staticcheck`](settings.md#staticcheck`) boolean option is
unset, slightly more than half of these analyzers are enabled by
default; this subset has been chosen for precision and efficiency. Set
`staticcheck` to `true` to enable the complete set, or to `false` to
disable the complete set.

Staticcheck analyzers, like all other analyzers, can be explicitly
enabled or disabled using the `analyzers` configuration setting; this
setting takes precedence over the `staticcheck` setting, so,
regardless of what value of `staticcheck` you use (true/false/unset),
you can make adjustments to your preferred set of analyzers.

<a id='S1000'></a>
## `S1000`: Use plain channel send or receive instead of single-case select


Select statements with a single case can be replaced with a simple
send or receive.

Before:

    select {
    case x := <-ch:
        fmt.Println(x)
    }

After:

    x := <-ch
    fmt.Println(x)

Package documentation: [S1000](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1000)

<a id='S1001'></a>
## `S1001`: Replace for loop with call to copy


Use copy() for copying elements from one slice to another. For
arrays of identical size, you can use simple assignment.

Before:

    for i, x := range src {
        dst[i] = x
    }

After:

    copy(dst, src)

Available since
    2017.1

Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1002": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1002](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1002)

<a id='S1003'></a>
## `S1003`: Replace call to strings.Index with strings.Contains

Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1004](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1004)

<a id='S1005'></a>
## `S1005`: Drop unnecessary use of the blank identifier


In many cases, assigning to the blank identifier is unnecessary.

Before:

    for _ = range s {}
    x, _ = someMap[key]
    _ = <-ch

After:

    for range s{}
    x = someMap[key]
    <-ch

Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1006": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1006](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1006)

<a id='S1007'></a>
## `S1007`: Simplify regular expression by using raw string literal


Raw string literals use backticks instead of quotation marks and do not support
any escape sequences. This means that the backslash can be used
freely, without the need of escaping.

Since regular expressions have their own escape sequences, raw strings
can improve their readability.

Before:

    regexp.Compile("\\A(\\w+) profile: total \\d+\\n\\z")

After:

    regexp.Compile(`\A(\w+) profile: total \d+\n\z`)

Available since
    2017.1

Package documentation: [S1008](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1008)

<a id='S1009'></a>
## `S1009`: Omit redundant nil check on slices, maps, and channels


The len function is defined for all slices, maps, and
channels, even nil ones, which have a length of zero. It is not necessary to
check for nil before checking that their length is not zero.

Before:

    if x != nil && len(x) != 0 {}

After:

    if len(x) != 0 {}

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1009](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1009)

<a id='S1010'></a>
## `S1010`: Omit default slice index


When slicing, the second index defaults to the length of the value,
making s[n:len(s)] and s[n:] equivalent.

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1010](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1010)

<a id='S1011'></a>
## `S1011`: Use a single append to concatenate two slices


Before:

    for _, e := range y {
        x = append(x, e)
    }
    
    for i := range y {
        x = append(x, y[i])
    }
    
    for i := range y {
        v := y[i]
        x = append(x, v)
    }

After:

    x = append(x, y...)
    x = append(x, y...)
    x = append(x, y...)

Available since
    2017.1


Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1011": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1011](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1011)

<a id='S1012'></a>
## `S1012`: Replace time.Now().Sub(x) with time.Since(x)


The time.Since helper has the same effect as using time.Now().Sub(x)
but is easier to read.

Before:

    time.Now().Sub(x)

After:

    time.Since(x)

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1012](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1012)

<a id='S1016'></a>
## `S1016`: Use a type conversion instead of manually copying struct fields


Two struct types with identical fields can be converted between each
other. In older versions of Go, the fields had to have identical
struct tags. Since Go 1.8, however, struct tags are ignored during
conversions. It is thus not necessary to manually copy every field
individually.

Before:

    var x T1
    y := T2{
        Field1: x.Field1,
        Field2: x.Field2,
    }

After:

    var x T1
    y := T2(x)

Available since
    2017.1


Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1016": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1016](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1016)

<a id='S1017'></a>
## `S1017`: Replace manual trimming with strings.TrimPrefix


Instead of using strings.HasPrefix and manual slicing, use the
strings.TrimPrefix function. If the string doesn't start with the
prefix, the original string will be returned. Using strings.TrimPrefix
reduces complexity, and avoids common bugs, such as off-by-one
mistakes.

Before:

    if strings.HasPrefix(str, prefix) {
        str = str[len(prefix):]
    }

After:

    str = strings.TrimPrefix(str, prefix)

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1017](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1017)

<a id='S1018'></a>
## `S1018`: Use 'copy' for sliding elements


copy() permits using the same source and destination slice, even with
overlapping ranges. This makes it ideal for sliding elements in a
slice.

Before:

    for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
        bs[i] = bs[offset+i]
    }

After:

    copy(bs[:n], bs[offset:])

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1018](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1018)

<a id='S1019'></a>
## `S1019`: Simplify 'make' call by omitting redundant arguments


The 'make' function has default values for the length and capacity
arguments. For channels, the length defaults to zero, and for slices,
the capacity defaults to the length.

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1019](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1019)

<a id='S1020'></a>
## `S1020`: Omit redundant nil check in type assertion


Before:

    if _, ok := i.(T); ok && i != nil {}

After:

    if _, ok := i.(T); ok {}

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1020](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1020)

<a id='S1021'></a>
## `S1021`: Merge variable declaration and assignment


Before:

    var x uint
    x = 1

After:

    var x uint = 1

Available since
    2017.1


Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1021": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1021](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1021)

<a id='S1023'></a>
## `S1023`: Omit redundant control flow


Functions that have no return value do not need a return statement as
the final statement of the function.

Switches in Go do not have automatic fallthrough, unlike languages
like C. It is not necessary to have a break statement as the final
statement in a case block.

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1023](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1023)

<a id='S1024'></a>
## `S1024`: Replace x.Sub(time.Now()) with time.Until(x)


The time.Until helper has the same effect as using x.Sub(time.Now())
but is easier to read.

Before:

    x.Sub(time.Now())

After:

    time.Until(x)

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1024](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1024)

<a id='S1025'></a>
## `S1025`: Don't use fmt.Sprintf("%s", x) unnecessarily


In many instances, there are easier and more efficient ways of getting
a value's string representation. Whenever a value's underlying type is
a string already, or the type has a String method, they should be used
directly.

Given the following shared definitions

    type T1 string
    type T2 int

    func (T2) String() string { return "Hello, world" }

    var x string
    var y T1
    var z T2

we can simplify

    fmt.Sprintf("%s", x)
    fmt.Sprintf("%s", y)
    fmt.Sprintf("%s", z)

to

    x
    string(y)
    z.String()

Available since
    2017.1


Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1025": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1025](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1025)

<a id='S1028'></a>
## `S1028`: Simplify error construction with fmt.Errorf


Before:

    errors.New(fmt.Sprintf(...))

After:

    fmt.Errorf(...)

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1028](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1028)

<a id='S1029'></a>
## `S1029`: Range over the string directly


Ranging over a string will yield byte offsets and runes. If the offset
isn't used, this is functionally equivalent to converting the string
to a slice of runes and ranging over that. Ranging directly over the
string will be more performant, however, as it avoids allocating a new
slice, the size of which depends on the length of the string.

Before:

    for _, r := range []rune(s) {}

After:

    for _, r := range s {}

Available since
    2017.1


Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"S1029": true}`.

Package documentation: [S1029](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1029)

<a id='S1030'></a>
## `S1030`: Use bytes.Buffer.String or bytes.Buffer.Bytes


bytes.Buffer has both a String and a Bytes method. It is almost never
necessary to use string(buf.Bytes()) or []byte(buf.String()) – simply
use the other method.

The only exception to this are map lookups. Due to a compiler optimization,
m[string(buf.Bytes())] is more efficient than m[buf.String()].

Available since
    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1030](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1030)

<a id='S1031'></a>
## `S1031`: Omit redundant nil check around loop


You can use range on nil slices and maps, the loop will simply never
execute. This makes an additional nil check around the loop
unnecessary.

Before:

    if s != nil {
        for _, x := range s {
            ...
        }
    }

After:

    for _, x := range s {
        ...
    }

    2017.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1031](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1031)

<a id='S1032'></a>
## `S1032`: Use sort.Ints(x), sort.Float64s(x), and sort.Strings(x)


The sort.Ints, sort.Float64s and sort.Strings functions are easier to
read than sort.Sort(sort.IntSlice(x)), sort.Sort(sort.Float64Slice(x))
and sort.Sort(sort.StringSlice(x)).

Before:

    sort.Sort(sort.StringSlice(x))

After:

    sort.Strings(x)

    2019.1


Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1032](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1032)

## `S1033`: Unnecessary guard around call to 'delete'


Calling delete on a nil map is a no-op.

## `S1035`: Redundant call to net/http.CanonicalHeaderKey in method call on net/http.Header


The methods on net/http.Header, namely Add, Del, Get
and Set, already canonicalize the given header name.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [S1035](https://staticcheck.dev/docs/checks/#S1035)

<a id='S1036'></a>
## `S1036`: Unnecessary guard around map access


When accessing a map key that doesn't exist yet, one receives a zero
value. Often, the zero value is a suitable value, for example when
using append or doing integer math.

The following

    if _, ok := m["foo"]; ok {
        m["foo"] = append(m["foo"], "bar")
    } else {
        m["foo"] = []string{"bar"}
    }

can be simplified to

    m["foo"] = append(m["foo"], "bar")

and

    if _, ok := m2["k"]; ok {
        m2["k"] += 4
    } else {
        m2["k"] = 4
    }

can be simplified to

    m["k"] += 4

<a id='S1037'></a>
## `S1037`: Elaborate way of sleeping


Using a select statement with a single case receiving
from the result of time.After is a very elaborate way of sleeping that
can much simpler be expressed with a simple call to time.Sleep.

<a id='S1039'></a>
## `S1039`: Unnecessary use of fmt.Sprint


Calling fmt.Sprint with a single string argument is unnecessary

<a id='S1040'></a>
## `S1040`: Type assertion to current type


The type assertion x.(SomeInterface), when x already has type
SomeInterface, can only fail if x is nil. Usually, this is
left-over code from when x had a different type and you can safely
delete the type assertion. If you want to check that x is not nil,
consider being explicit and using an actual if x == nil comparison
instead of relying on the type assertion panicking.

## `SA1003`: Unsupported argument to functions in encoding/binary


The encoding/binary package can only serialize types with known sizes.
This precludes the use of the int and uint types, as their sizes
differ on different architectures. Furthermore, it doesn't support
serializing maps, channels, strings, or functions.

Before Go 1.8, bool wasn't supported, either.

## `SA1004`: Suspiciously small untyped constant in time.Sleep


The time.Sleep function takes a time.Duration as its only argument.
Durations are expressed in nanoseconds. Thus, calling time.Sleep(1)
will sleep for 1 nanosecond. This is a common source of bugs, as sleep
functions in other languages often accept seconds or milliseconds.

The time package provides constants such as time.Second to express
large durations. These can be combined with arithmetic to express
arbitrary durations, for example 5 * time.Second for 5 seconds.

If you truly meant to sleep for a tiny amount of time, use
n * time.Nanosecond to signal to Staticcheck that you did mean to sleep
for some amount of nanoseconds.

## `SA1005`: Invalid first argument to exec.Command


os/exec runs programs directly (using variants of the fork and exec
system calls on Unix systems). This shouldn't be confused with running
a command in a shell. The shell will allow for features such as input
redirection, pipes, and general scripting. The shell is also
responsible for splitting the user's input into a program name and its
arguments. For example, the equivalent to

    ls / /tmp

would be

    exec.Command("ls", "/", "/tmp")

If you want to run a command in a shell, consider using something like
the following – but be aware that not all systems, particularly
Windows, will have a /bin/sh program:

    exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", "ls | grep Awesome")

## `SA1008`: Non-canonical key in http.Header map


Keys in http.Header maps are canonical, meaning they follow a specific
combination of uppercase and lowercase letters. Methods such as
http.Header.Add and http.Header.Del convert inputs into this canonical
form before manipulating the map.

When manipulating http.Header maps directly, as opposed to using the
provided methods, care should be taken to stick to canonical form in
order to avoid inconsistencies. The following piece of code
demonstrates one such inconsistency:

    h := http.Header{}
    h["etag"] = []string{"1234"}
    h.Add("etag", "5678")
    fmt.Println(h)

    // Output:
    // map[Etag:[5678] etag:[1234]]

The easiest way of obtaining the canonical form of a key is to use
http.CanonicalHeaderKey.

ticker, using it repeatedly would leak memory.

Go 1.23 fixes this by allowing tickers to be collected even if they weren't closed.

avoid missing signals, the channel should be buffered and of the
appropriate size. For a channel used for notification of just one

## `SA2001`: Empty critical section, did you mean to defer the unlock?


Empty critical sections of the kind

Do note that sometimes empty critical sections can be useful, as a
form of signaling to wait on another goroutine. Many times, there are
simpler ways of achieving the same effect. When that isn't the case,
the code should be amply commented to avoid confusion. Combining such
comments with a //lint:ignore directive can be used to suppress this

## `SA4020`: Unreachable case clause in a type switch


In a type switch like the following

    type T struct{}
    func (T) Read(b []byte) (int, error) { return 0, nil }

    var v any = T{}

    switch v.(type) {
    case io.Reader:
        // ...
    case T:
        // unreachable
    }

the second case clause can never be reached because T implements
io.Reader and case clauses are evaluated in source order.

Another example:

    type T struct{}
    func (T) Read(b []byte) (int, error) { return 0, nil }
    func (T) Close() error { return nil }

    var v any = T{}

    switch v.(type) {
    case io.Reader:
        // ...
    case io.ReadCloser:
        // unreachable
    }

Even though T has a Close method and thus implements io.ReadCloser,
io.Reader will always match first. The method set of io.Reader is a
subset of io.ReadCloser. Thus it is impossible to match the second
case without matching the first case.


Structurally equivalent interfaces

A special case of the previous example are structurally identical
interfaces. Given these declarations

    type T error
    type V error

    func doSomething() error {
        err, ok := doAnotherThing()
        if ok {
            return T(err)
        }

        return U(err)
    }

the following type switch will have an unreachable case clause:

    switch doSomething().(type) {
    case T:
        // ...
    case V:
        // unreachable
    }

T will always match before V because they are structurally equivalent
and therefore doSomething()'s return value implements both.

## `SA4022`: Comparing the address of a variable against nil

## `SA4023`: Impossible comparison of interface value with untyped nil


Under the covers, interfaces are implemented as two elements, a
type T and a value V. V is a concrete value such as an int,
struct or pointer, never an interface itself, and has type T. For
instance, if we store the int value 3 in an interface, the
resulting interface value has, schematically, (T=int, V=3). The
value V is also known as the interface's dynamic value, since a
given interface variable might hold different values V (and
corresponding types T) during the execution of the program.

An interface value is nil only if the V and T are both
unset, (T=nil, V is not set), In particular, a nil interface will
always hold a nil type. If we store a nil pointer of type *int
inside an interface value, the inner type will be *int regardless
of the value of the pointer: (T=*int, V=nil). Such an interface
value will therefore be non-nil even when the pointer value V
inside is nil.

This situation can be confusing, and arises when a nil value is
stored inside an interface value such as an error return:

    func returnsError() error {
        var p *MyError = nil
        if bad() {
            p = ErrBad
        }
        return p // Will always return a non-nil error.
    }

If all goes well, the function returns a nil p, so the return
value is an error interface value holding (T=*MyError, V=nil).
This means that if the caller compares the returned error to nil,
it will always look as if there was an error even if nothing bad
happened. To return a proper nil error to the caller, the
function must return an explicit nil:

    func returnsError() error {
        if bad() {
            return ErrBad
        }
        return nil
    }

It's a good idea for functions that return errors always to use
the error type in their signature (as we did above) rather than a
concrete type such as *MyError, to help guarantee the error is
created correctly. As an example, os.Open returns an error even
though, if not nil, it's always of concrete type *os.PathError.

Similar situations to those described here can arise whenever
interfaces are used. Just keep in mind that if any concrete value
has been stored in the interface, the interface will not be nil.

## `SA4025`: Integer division of literals that results in zero


When dividing two integer constants, the result will
also be an integer. Thus, a division such as 2 / 3 results in 0.
This is true for all of the following examples:

	_ = 2 / 3
	const _ = 2 / 3
	const _ float64 = 2 / 3
	_ = float64(2 / 3)

Staticcheck will flag such divisions if both sides of the division are
integer literals, as it is highly unlikely that the division was
intended to truncate to zero. Staticcheck will not flag integer
division involving named constants, to avoid noisy positives.

## `SA4026`: Go constants cannot express negative zero


In IEEE 754 floating point math, zero has a sign and can be positive
or negative. This can be useful in certain numerical code.

Go constants, however, cannot express negative zero. This means that
the literals -0.0 and 0.0 have the same ideal value (zero) and
will both represent positive zero at runtime.

To explicitly and reliably create a negative zero, you can use the
math.Copysign function: math.Copysign(0, -1).

this map will not affect the URL unless the map gets encoded and

## `SA5005`: The finalizer references the finalized object, preventing garbage collection


A finalizer is a function associated with an object that runs when the
garbage collector is ready to collect said object, that is when the
object is no longer referenced by anything.

If the finalizer references the object, however, it will always remain
as the final reference to that object, preventing the garbage
collector from collecting the object. The finalizer will never run,
and the object will never be collected, leading to a memory leak. That
is why the finalizer should instead use its first argument to operate
on the object. That way, the number of references can temporarily go
to zero before the object is being passed to the finalizer.

## `SA5007`: Infinite recursive call


A function that calls itself recursively needs to have an exit
condition. Otherwise it will recurse forever, until the system runs

This issue can be caused by simple bugs such as forgetting to add an
exit condition. It can also happen "on purpose". Some languages have
tail call optimization which makes certain infinite recursive calls
safe to use. Go, however, does not implement TCO, and as such a loop
should be used instead.

## `SA5010`: Impossible type assertion


Some type assertions can be statically proven to be
impossible. This is the case when the method sets of both
arguments of the type assertion conflict with each other, for
example by containing the same method with different
signatures.

The Go compiler already applies this check when asserting from an
interface value to a concrete type. If the concrete type misses
methods from the interface, or if function signatures don't match,
then the type assertion can never succeed.

This check applies the same logic when asserting from one interface to
another. If both interface types contain the same method but with
different signatures, then the type assertion can never succeed,
either.

## `SA5011`: Possible nil pointer dereference


A pointer is being dereferenced unconditionally, while
also being checked against nil in another place. This suggests that
the pointer may be nil and dereferencing it may panic. This is
commonly a result of improperly ordered code or missing return
statements. Consider the following examples:

    func fn(x *int) {
        fmt.Println(*x)

        // This nil check is equally important for the previous dereference
        if x != nil {
            foo(*x)
        }
    }

    func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
        x := compute()
        if x == nil {
            t.Errorf("nil pointer received")
        }

        // t.Errorf does not abort the test, so if x is nil, the next line will panic.
        foo(*x)
    }

Staticcheck tries to deduce which functions abort control flow.
For example, it is aware that a function will not continue
execution after a call to panic or log.Fatal. However, sometimes
this detection fails, in particular in the presence of
conditionals. Consider the following example:

    func Log(msg string, level int) {
        fmt.Println(msg)
        if level == levelFatal {
            os.Exit(1)
        }
    }

    func Fatal(msg string) {
        Log(msg, levelFatal)
    }

    func fn(x *int) {
        if x == nil {
            Fatal("unexpected nil pointer")
        }
        fmt.Println(*x)
    }

Staticcheck will flag the dereference of x, even though it is perfectly
safe. Staticcheck is not able to deduce that a call to
Fatal will exit the program. For the time being, the easiest
workaround is to modify the definition of Fatal like so:

    func Fatal(msg string) {
        Log(msg, levelFatal)
        panic("unreachable")
    }

We also hard-code functions from common logging packages such as
logrus. Please file an issue if we're missing support for a
popular package.

## `SA6001`: Missing an optimization opportunity when indexing maps by byte slices


Map keys must be comparable, which precludes the use of byte slices.
This usually leads to using string keys and converting byte slices to
strings.

Normally, a conversion of a byte slice to a string needs to copy the data and
causes allocations. The compiler, however, recognizes m[string(b)] and
uses the data of b directly, without copying it, because it knows that
the data can't change during the map lookup. This leads to the
counter-intuitive situation that

    k := string(b)
    println(m[k])
    println(m[k])

will be less efficient than

    println(m[string(b)])
    println(m[string(b)])

because the first version needs to copy and allocate, while the second
one does not.

For some history on this optimization, check out commit
f5f5a8b6209f84961687d993b93ea0d397f5d5bf in the Go repository.

## `SA6002`: Storing non-pointer values in sync.Pool allocates memory


A sync.Pool is used to avoid unnecessary allocations and reduce the
amount of work the garbage collector has to do.

When passing a value that is not a pointer to a function that accepts
an interface, the value needs to be placed on the heap, which means an
additional allocation. Slices are a common thing to put in sync.Pools,
and they're structs with 3 fields (length, capacity, and a pointer to
an array). In order to avoid the extra allocation, one should store a
pointer to the slice instead.

that discuss this problem.

## `SA6003`: Converting a string to a slice of runes before ranging over it


You may want to loop over the runes in a string. Instead of converting
the string to a slice of runes and looping over that, you can loop
over the string itself. That is,

    for _, r := range s {}

and

    for _, r := range []rune(s) {}

will yield the same values. The first version, however, will be faster
and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

Do note that if you are interested in the indices, ranging over a
string and over a slice of runes will yield different indices. The
first one yields byte offsets, while the second one yields indices in
the slice of runes.

## `SA6005`: Inefficient string comparison with strings.ToLower or strings.ToUpper


Converting two strings to the same case and comparing them like so

    if strings.ToLower(s1) == strings.ToLower(s2) {
        ...
    }

is significantly more expensive than comparing them with
strings.EqualFold(s1, s2). This is due to memory usage as well as
computational complexity.

strings.ToLower will have to allocate memory for the new strings, as
well as convert both strings fully, even if they differ on the very
first byte. strings.EqualFold, on the other hand, compares the strings
one character at a time. It doesn't need to create two intermediate
strings and can return as soon as the first non-matching character has
been found.

## `SA9004`: Only the first constant has an explicit type


In a constant declaration such as the following:

    const (
        First byte = 1
        Second     = 2
    )

the constant Second does not have the same type as the constant First.
This construct shouldn't be confused with

    const (
        First byte = iota
        Second
    )

where First and Second do indeed have the same type. The type is only
passed on when no explicit value is assigned to the constant.

When declaring enumerations with explicit values it is therefore
important not to write

    const (
          EnumFirst EnumType = 1
          EnumSecond         = 2
          EnumThird          = 3
    )

This discrepancy in types can cause various confusing behaviors and
bugs.


Wrong type in variable declarations

The most obvious issue with such incorrect enumerations expresses
itself as a compile error:

    package pkg

    const (
        EnumFirst  uint8 = 1
        EnumSecond       = 2
    )

    func fn(useFirst bool) {
        x := EnumSecond
        if useFirst {
            x = EnumFirst
        }
    }

fails to compile with

    ./const.go:11:5: cannot use EnumFirst (type uint8) as type int in assignment


Losing method sets

A more subtle issue occurs with types that have methods and optional
interfaces. Consider the following:

    package main

    import "fmt"

    type Enum int

    func (e Enum) String() string {
        return "an enum"
    }

    const (
        EnumFirst  Enum = 1
        EnumSecond      = 2
    )

    func main() {
        fmt.Println(EnumFirst)
        fmt.Println(EnumSecond)
    }

This code will output

    an enum
    2

as EnumSecond has no explicit type, and thus defaults to int.

## `SA9008`: else branch of a type assertion is probably not reading the right value


When declaring variables as part of an if statement (like in 'if
foo := ...; foo {'), the same variables will also be in the scope of

    if x, ok := x.(int); ok {
        // ...
    } else {

    }

x in the else branch will refer to the x from x, ok
:=; it will not refer to the x that is being type-asserted. The
result of a failed type assertion is the zero value of the type that
is being asserted to, so x in the else branch will always have the
value 0 and the type int.

## `ST1005`: Incorrectly formatted error string


Error strings follow a set of guidelines to ensure uniformity and good
composability.

Quoting Go Code Review Comments:

> Error strings should not be capitalized (unless beginning with
> proper nouns or acronyms) or end with punctuation, since they are
> usually printed following other context. That is, use
> fmt.Errorf("something bad") not fmt.Errorf("Something bad"), so
> that log.Printf("Reading %s: %v", filename, err) formats without a
> spurious capital letter mid-message.

## `ST1006`: Poorly chosen receiver name


Quoting Go Code Review Comments:

> The name of a method's receiver should be a reflection of its
> identity; often a one or two letter abbreviation of its type
> suffices (such as "c" or "cl" for "Client"). Don't use generic
> names such as "me", "this" or "self", identifiers typical of
> object-oriented languages that place more emphasis on methods as
> opposed to functions. The name need not be as descriptive as that
> of a method argument, as its role is obvious and serves no
> documentary purpose. It can be very short as it will appear on
> almost every line of every method of the type; familiarity admits
> brevity. Be consistent, too: if you call the receiver "c" in one
> method, don't call it "cl" in another.

## `ST1011`: Poorly chosen name for variable of type time.Duration


time.Duration values represent an amount of time, which is represented
as a count of nanoseconds. An expression like 5 * time.Microsecond
yields the value 5000. It is therefore not appropriate to suffix a
variable of type time.Duration with any time unit, such as Msec or
Milli.

## `ST1013`: Should use constants for HTTP error codes, not magic numbers


HTTP has a tremendous number of status codes. While some of those are
well known (200, 400, 404, 500), most of them are not. The net/http
package provides constants for all status codes that are part of the
various specifications. It is recommended to use these constants
instead of hard-coding magic numbers, to vastly improve the
readability of your code.

## `ST1017`: Don't use Yoda conditions


Yoda conditions are conditions of the kind 'if 42 == x', where the
literal is on the left side of the comparison. These are a common
idiom in languages in which assignment is an expression, to avoid bugs
of the kind 'if (x = 42)'. In Go, which doesn't allow for this kind of
bug, we prefer the more idiomatic 'if x == 42'.

<a id='ST1019'></a>
## `ST1019`: Importing the same package multiple times


Go allows importing the same package multiple times, as long as
different import aliases are being used. That is, the following
bit of code is valid:

    import (
        "fmt"
        fumpt "fmt"
        format "fmt"
        _ "fmt"
    )

However, this is very rarely done on purpose. Usually, it is a
sign of code that got refactored, accidentally adding duplicate
import statements. It is also a rarely known feature, which may
contribute to confusion.

Do note that sometimes, this feature may be used
intentionally (see for example
https://github.com/golang/go/commit/3409ce39bfd7584523b7a8c150a310cea92d879d)
– if you want to allow this pattern in your code base, you're
advised to disable this check.

## `cgocall`: detect some violations of the cgo pointer passing rules


Check for invalid cgo pointer passing.
This looks for code that uses cgo to call C code passing values
whose types are almost always invalid according to the cgo pointer
sharing rules.
Specifically, it warns about attempts to pass a Go chan, map, func,
or slice to C, either directly, or via a pointer, array, or struct.

Default: on.

<a id='composites'></a>
## `composites`: check for unkeyed composite literals


This analyzer reports a diagnostic for composite literals of struct
types imported from another package that do not use the field-keyed
syntax. Such literals are fragile because the addition of a new field
(even if unexported) to the struct will cause compilation to fail.

As an example,

	err = &net.DNSConfigError{err}

should be replaced by:

	err = &net.DNSConfigError{Err: err}


Default: on.

<a id='copylocks'></a>
## `copylocks`: check for locks erroneously passed by value


Inadvertently copying a value containing a lock, such as sync.Mutex or

<a id='deepequalerrors'></a>
## `deepequalerrors`: check for calls of reflect.DeepEqual on error values


The deepequalerrors checker looks for calls of the form:

where err1 and err2 are errors. Using reflect.DeepEqual to compare
errors is discouraged.

Default: on.

<a id='defers'></a>
## `defers`: report common mistakes in defer statements


The defers analyzer reports a diagnostic when a defer statement would
result in a non-deferred call to time.Since, as experience has shown
that this is nearly always a mistake.

For example:

	start := time.Now()
	...
	defer recordLatency(time.Since(start)) // error: call to time.Since is not deferred

The correct code is:

	defer func() { recordLatency(time.Since(start)) }()

Default: on.

Package documentation: [defers](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/defers)

<a id='deprecated'></a>
## `deprecated`: check for use of deprecated identifiers


The deprecated analyzer looks for deprecated symbols and package
imports.

See https://go.dev/wiki/Deprecated to learn about Go's convention
for documenting and signaling deprecated identifiers.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [deprecated](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/deprecated)

<a id='directive'></a>
## `directive`: check Go toolchain directives such as //go:debug


This analyzer checks for problems with known Go toolchain directives
in all Go source files in a package directory, even those excluded by
//go:build constraints, and all non-Go source files too.

For //go:debug (see https://go.dev/doc/godebug), the analyzer checks
that the directives are placed only in Go source files, only above the
package comment, and only in package main or *_test.go files.

Support for other known directives may be added in the future.

This analyzer does not check //go:build, which is handled by the
buildtag analyzer.


Default: on.

Package documentation: [directive](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/directive)

<a id='embed'></a>

This analyzer also checks that //go:embed directives precede the
declaration of a single variable.

Default: on.

<a id='errorsas'></a>
## `errorsas`: report passing non-pointer or non-error values to errors.As

<a id='fillreturns'></a>
## `fillreturns`: suggest fixes for errors due to an incorrect number of return values


This checker provides suggested fixes for type errors of the
type "wrong number of return values (want %d, got %d)". For example:

	func m() (int, string, *bool, error) {
		return
	}

will turn into

	func m() (int, string, *bool, error) {
		return 0, "", nil, nil
	}

<a id='gofix'></a>
## `gofix`: apply fixes based on go:fix comment directives


The gofix analyzer inlines functions and constants that are marked for inlining.

## Functions

Given a function that is marked for inlining, like this one:

	//go:fix inline
	func Square(x int) int { return Pow(x, 2) }

this analyzer will recommend that calls to the function elsewhere, in the same
or other packages, should be inlined.

Inlining can be used to move off of a deprecated function:

	// Deprecated: prefer Pow(x, 2).
	//go:fix inline
	func Square(x int) int { return Pow(x, 2) }

It can also be used to move off of an obsolete package,
as when the import path has changed or a higher major version is available:

	package pkg

	import pkg2 "pkg/v2"

	//go:fix inline
	func F() { pkg2.F(nil) }

Replacing a call pkg.F() by pkg2.F(nil) can have no effect on the program,
so this mechanism provides a low-risk way to update large numbers of calls.
We recommend, where possible, expressing the old API in terms of the new one
to enable automatic migration.

The inliner takes care to avoid behavior changes, even subtle ones,
such as changes to the order in which argument expressions are
evaluated. When it cannot safely eliminate all parameter variables,
it may introduce a "binding declaration" of the form

	var params = args

to evaluate argument expressions in the correct order and bind them to
parameter variables. Since the resulting code transformation may be
stylistically suboptimal, such inlinings may be disabled by specifying
the -gofix.allow_binding_decl=false flag to the analyzer driver.

(In cases where it is not safe to "reduce" a call—that is, to replace
a call f(x) by the body of function f, suitably substituted—the
inliner machinery is capable of replacing f by a function literal,
func(){...}(). However, the gofix analyzer discards all such
"literalizations" unconditionally, again on grounds of style.)

## Constants

Given a constant that is marked for inlining, like this one:

	//go:fix inline
	const Ptr = Pointer

this analyzer will recommend that uses of Ptr should be replaced with Pointer.

As with functions, inlining can be used to replace deprecated constants and
constants in obsolete packages.

A constant definition can be marked for inlining only if it refers to another
named constant.

The "//go:fix inline" comment must appear before a single const declaration on its own,
as above; before a const declaration that is part of a group, as in this case:

	const (
	   C = 1
	   //go:fix inline
	   Ptr = Pointer
	)

or before a group, applying to every constant in the group:

	//go:fix inline
	const (
		Ptr = Pointer
	    Val = Value
	)

The proposal https://go.dev/issue/32816 introduces the "//go:fix" directives.

You can use this (officially unsupported) command to apply gofix fixes en masse:

	$ go run golang.org/x/tools/internal/gofix/cmd/gofix@latest -test ./...

(Do not use "go get -tool" to add gopls as a dependency of your
module; gopls commands must be built from their release branch.)

Default: on.

Package documentation: [gofix](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/internal/gofix)

<a id='hostport'></a>
## `hostport`: check format of addresses passed to net.Dial


This analyzer flags code that produce network address strings using
fmt.Sprintf, as in this example:

    addr := fmt.Sprintf("%s:%d", host, 12345) // "will not work with IPv6"
    ...
    conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", addr)       // "when passed to dial here"

The analyzer suggests a fix to use the correct approach, a call to
net.JoinHostPort:

    addr := net.JoinHostPort(host, "12345")
    ...
    conn, err := net.Dial("tcp", addr)

A similar diagnostic and fix are produced for a format string of "%s:%s".


Default: on.

Package documentation: [hostport](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/hostport)

<a id='httpresponse'></a>
## `httpresponse`: check for mistakes using HTTP responses


A common mistake when using the net/http package is to defer a function
call to close the http.Response Body before checking the error that
determines whether the response is valid:

	resp, err := http.Head(url)
	defer resp.Body.Close()
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatal(err)
	}
	// (defer statement belongs here)

This checker helps uncover latent nil dereference bugs by reporting a
diagnostic for such mistakes.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [httpresponse](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/httpresponse)

<a id='ifaceassert'></a>
## `ifaceassert`: detect impossible interface-to-interface type assertions


This checker flags type assertions v.(T) and corresponding type-switch cases
in which the static type V of v is an interface that cannot possibly implement
the target interface T. This occurs when V and T contain methods with the same
name but different signatures. Example:

	var v interface {
		Read()
	}
	_ = v.(io.Reader)

The Read method in v has a different signature than the Read method in
io.Reader, so this assertion cannot succeed.

Default: on.

<a id='infertypeargs'></a>
## `infertypeargs`: check for unnecessary type arguments in call expressions


Explicit type arguments may be omitted from call expressions if they can be
inferred from function arguments, or from other type arguments:

	func f[T any](T) {}
	
	func _() {
		f[string]("foo") // string could be inferred
	}


Default: on.

Package documentation: [infertypeargs](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/infertypeargs)

<a id='loopclosure'></a>
## `loopclosure`: check references to loop variables from within nested functions


This analyzer reports places where a function literal references the
iteration variable of an enclosing loop, and the loop calls the function
in such a way (e.g. with go or defer) that it may outlive the loop
iteration and possibly observe the wrong value of the variable.

Note: An iteration variable can only outlive a loop iteration in Go versions <=1.21.
In Go 1.22 and later, the loop variable lifetimes changed to create a new
iteration variable per loop iteration. (See go.dev/issue/60078.)

In this example, all the deferred functions run after the loop has
completed, so all observe the final value of v [<go1.22].

	for _, v := range list {
	    defer func() {
	        use(v) // incorrect
	    }()
	}

One fix is to create a new variable for each iteration of the loop:

	for _, v := range list {
	    v := v // new var per iteration
	    defer func() {
	        use(v) // ok
	    }()
	}

After Go version 1.22, the previous two for loops are equivalent
and both are correct.

The next example uses a go statement and has a similar problem [<go1.22].
In addition, it has a data race because the loop updates v
concurrent with the goroutines accessing it.

	for _, v := range elem {
	    go func() {
	        use(v)  // incorrect, and a data race
	    }()
	}

A fix is the same as before. The checker also reports problems
in goroutines started by golang.org/x/sync/errgroup.Group.
A hard-to-spot variant of this form is common in parallel tests:

	func Test(t *testing.T) {
	    for _, test := range tests {
	        t.Run(test.name, func(t *testing.T) {
	            t.Parallel()
	            use(test) // incorrect, and a data race
	        })
	    }
	}

The t.Parallel() call causes the rest of the function to execute
concurrent with the loop [<go1.22].

The analyzer reports references only in the last statement,
as it is not deep enough to understand the effects of subsequent
statements that might render the reference benign.
("Last statement" is defined recursively in compound
statements such as if, switch, and select.)

See: https://golang.org/doc/go_faq.html#closures_and_goroutines

Default: on.

<a id='lostcancel'></a>
## `lostcancel`: check cancel func returned by context.WithCancel is called


The cancellation function returned by context.WithCancel, WithTimeout,
WithDeadline and variants such as WithCancelCause must be called,
or the new context will remain live until its parent context is cancelled.
(The background context is never cancelled.)

Default: on.

<a id='maprange'></a>
## `maprange`: checks for unnecessary calls to maps.Keys and maps.Values in range statements


Consider a loop written like this:

	for val := range maps.Values(m) {
		fmt.Println(val)
	}

This should instead be written without the call to maps.Values:

	for _, val := range m {
		fmt.Println(val)
	}

golang.org/x/exp/maps returns slices for Keys/Values instead of iterators,
but unnecessary calls should similarly be removed:

	for _, key := range maps.Keys(m) {
		fmt.Println(key)
	}

should be rewritten as:

	for key := range m {
		fmt.Println(key)
	}

Default: on.

Package documentation: [maprange](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/maprange)

<a id='modernize'></a>
## `modernize`: simplify code by using modern constructs


This analyzer reports opportunities for simplifying and clarifying
existing code by using more modern features of Go and its standard
library.

Each diagnostic provides a fix. Our intent is that these fixes may
be safely applied en masse without changing the behavior of your
program. In some cases the suggested fixes are imperfect and may
lead to (for example) unused imports or unused local variables,
causing build breakage. However, these problems are generally
trivial to fix. We regard any modernizer whose fix changes program
behavior to have a serious bug and will endeavor to fix it.

To apply all modernization fixes en masse, you can use the
following command:

	$ go run golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/modernize/cmd/modernize@latest -fix -test ./...

(Do not use "go get -tool" to add gopls as a dependency of your
module; gopls commands must be built from their release branch.)

If the tool warns of conflicting fixes, you may need to run it more
than once until it has applied all fixes cleanly. This command is
not an officially supported interface and may change in the future.

Changes produced by this tool should be reviewed as usual before
being merged. In some cases, a loop may be replaced by a simple
function call, causing comments within the loop to be discarded.
Human judgment may be required to avoid losing comments of value.

Each diagnostic reported by modernize has a specific category. (The
categories are listed below.) Diagnostics in some categories, such
as "efaceany" (which replaces "interface{}" with "any" where it is
safe to do so) are particularly numerous. It may ease the burden of
code review to apply fixes in two passes, the first change
consisting only of fixes of category "efaceany", the second
consisting of all others. This can be achieved using the -category flag:

	$ modernize -category=efaceany  -fix -test ./...
	$ modernize -category=-efaceany -fix -test ./...

Categories of modernize diagnostic:

  - forvar: remove x := x variable declarations made unnecessary by the new semantics of loops in go1.22.

  - slicescontains: replace 'for i, elem := range s { if elem == needle { ...; break }'
    by a call to slices.Contains, added in go1.21.

  - minmax: replace an if/else conditional assignment by a call to
    the built-in min or max functions added in go1.21.

  - sortslice: replace sort.Slice(s, func(i, j int) bool) { return s[i] < s[j] }
    by a call to slices.Sort(s), added in go1.21.

  - efaceany: replace interface{} by the 'any' type added in go1.18.

  - mapsloop: replace a loop around an m[k]=v map update by a call
    to one of the Collect, Copy, Clone, or Insert functions from
    the maps package, added in go1.21.

  - fmtappendf: replace []byte(fmt.Sprintf...) by fmt.Appendf(nil, ...),
    added in go1.19.

  - testingcontext: replace uses of context.WithCancel in tests
    with t.Context, added in go1.24.

  - omitzero: replace omitempty by omitzero on structs, added in go1.24.

  - bloop: replace "for i := range b.N" or "for range b.N" in a
    benchmark with "for b.Loop()", and remove any preceding calls
    to b.StopTimer, b.StartTimer, and b.ResetTimer.

    B.Loop intentionally defeats compiler optimizations such as
    inlining so that the benchmark is not entirely optimized away.
    Currently, however, it may cause benchmarks to become slower
    in some cases due to increased allocation; see
    https://go.dev/issue/73137.

  - rangeint: replace a 3-clause "for i := 0; i < n; i++" loop by
    "for i := range n", added in go1.22.

  - stringsseq: replace Split in "for range strings.Split(...)" by go1.24's
    more efficient SplitSeq, or Fields with FieldSeq.

  - stringscutprefix: replace some uses of HasPrefix followed by TrimPrefix with CutPrefix,
    added to the strings package in go1.20.

  - waitgroup: replace old complex usages of sync.WaitGroup by less complex WaitGroup.Go method in go1.25.

Default: on.

<a id='nilfunc'></a>
## `nilfunc`: check for useless comparisons between functions and nil


A useless comparison is one like f == nil as opposed to f() == nil.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [nilfunc](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/nilfunc)

<a id='nilness'></a>
## `nilness`: check for redundant or impossible nil comparisons


The nilness checker inspects the control-flow graph of each function in
a package and reports nil pointer dereferences, degenerate nil
pointers, and panics with nil values. A degenerate comparison is of the form
x==nil or x!=nil where x is statically known to be nil or non-nil. These are
often a mistake, especially in control flow related to errors. Panics with nil
values are checked because they are not detectable by

	if r := recover(); r != nil {

This check reports conditions such as:

	if f == nil { // impossible condition (f is a function)
	}

and:

	p := &v
	...
	if p != nil { // tautological condition
	}

and:

	if p == nil {
		print(*p) // nil dereference
	}

and:

	if p == nil {
		panic(p)
	}

Sometimes the control flow may be quite complex, making bugs hard
to spot. In the example below, the err.Error expression is
guaranteed to panic because, after the first return, err must be
nil. The intervening loop is just a distraction.

	...
	err := g.Wait()
	if err != nil {
		return err
	}
	partialSuccess := false
	for _, err := range errs {
		if err == nil {
			partialSuccess = true
			break
		}
	}
	if partialSuccess {
		reportStatus(StatusMessage{
			Code:   code.ERROR,
			Detail: err.Error(), // "nil dereference in dynamic method call"
		})
		return nil
	}

...

Default: on.

<a id='nonewvars'></a>
## `nonewvars`: suggested fixes for "no new vars on left side of :="


This checker provides suggested fixes for type errors of the
type "no new vars on left side of :=". For example:

	z := 1
	z := 2

will turn into

	z := 1
	z = 2

Default: on.

Package documentation: [nonewvars](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/nonewvars)

<a id='noresultvalues'></a>
## `noresultvalues`: suggested fixes for unexpected return values


This checker provides suggested fixes for type errors of the
type "no result values expected" or "too many return values".
For example:

	func z() { return nil }

will turn into

	func z() { return }

Default: on.

Package documentation: [noresultvalues](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/noresultvalues)

<a id='printf'></a>
## `printf`: check consistency of Printf format strings and arguments


The check applies to calls of the formatting functions such as
[fmt.Printf] and [fmt.Sprintf], as well as any detected wrappers of
those functions such as [log.Printf]. It reports a variety of
mistakes such as syntax errors in the format string and mismatches
(of number and type) between the verbs and their arguments.

See the documentation of the fmt package for the complete set of
format operators and their operand types.

Default: on.

<a id='recursiveiter'></a>
## `recursiveiter`: check for inefficient recursive iterators


This analyzer reports when a function that returns an iterator
(iter.Seq or iter.Seq2) calls itself as the operand of a range
statement, as this is inefficient.

When implementing an iterator (e.g. iter.Seq[T]) for a recursive
data type such as a tree or linked list, it is tempting to
recursively range over the iterator for each child element.

Here's an example of a naive iterator over a binary tree:

	type tree struct {
		value       int
		left, right *tree
	}

	func (t *tree) All() iter.Seq[int] {
		return func(yield func(int) bool) {
			if t != nil {
				for elem := range t.left.All() { // "inefficient recursive iterator"
					if !yield(elem) {
						return
					}
				}
				if !yield(t.value) {
					return
				}
				for elem := range t.right.All() { // "inefficient recursive iterator"
					if !yield(elem) {
						return
					}
				}
			}
		}
	}

Though it correctly enumerates the elements of the tree, it hides a
significant performance problem--two, in fact. Consider a balanced
tree of N nodes. Iterating the root node will cause All to be
called once on every node of the tree. This results in a chain of
nested active range-over-func statements when yield(t.value) is
called on a leaf node.

The first performance problem is that each range-over-func
statement must typically heap-allocate a variable, so iteration of
the tree allocates as many variables as there are elements in the
tree, for a total of O(N) allocations, all unnecessary.

The second problem is that each call to yield for a leaf of the
tree causes each of the enclosing range loops to receive a value,
which they then immediately pass on to their respective yield
function. This results in a chain of log(N) dynamic yield calls per
element, a total of O(N*log N) dynamic calls overall, when only
O(N) are necessary.

A better implementation strategy for recursive iterators is to
first define the "every" operator for your recursive data type,
where every(f) reports whether f(x) is true for every element x in
the data type. For our tree, the every function would be:

	func (t *tree) every(f func(int) bool) bool {
		return t == nil ||
			t.left.every(f) && f(t.value) && t.right.every(f)
	}

Then the iterator can be simply expressed as a trivial wrapper
around this function:

	func (t *tree) All() iter.Seq[int] {
		return func(yield func(int) bool) {
			_ = t.every(yield)
		}
	}

In effect, tree.All computes whether yield returns true for each
element, short-circuiting if it every returns false, then discards
the final boolean result.

This has much better performance characteristics: it makes one
dynamic call per element of the tree, and it doesn't heap-allocate
anything. It is also clearer.

Default: on.

<a id='shadow'></a>
## `shadow`: check for possible unintended shadowing of variables


This analyzer check for shadowed variables.
A shadowed variable is a variable declared in an inner scope
with the same name and type as a variable in an outer scope,
and where the outer variable is mentioned after the inner one
is declared.

(This definition can be refined; the module generates too many
false positives and is not yet enabled by default.)

For example:

	func BadRead(f *os.File, buf []byte) error {
		var err error
		for {
			n, err := f.Read(buf) // shadows the function variable 'err'
			if err != nil {
				break // causes return of wrong value
			}
			foo(buf)
		}
		return err
	}

Default: off. Enable by setting `"analyses": {"shadow": true}`.

Package documentation: [shadow](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shadow)

<a id='shift'></a>
## `shift`: check for shifts that equal or exceed the width of the integer



Default: on.

Package documentation: [shift](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/shift)

<a id='sigchanyzer'></a>
## `sigchanyzer`: check for unbuffered channel of os.Signal


This checker reports call expression of the form

	signal.Notify(c <-chan os.Signal, sig ...os.Signal),

where c is an unbuffered channel, which can be at risk of missing the signal.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [sigchanyzer](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/sigchanyzer)

<a id='simplifycompositelit'></a>
## `simplifycompositelit`: check for composite literal simplifications


An array, slice, or map composite literal of the form:

	[]T{T{}, T{}}

will be simplified to:

	[]T{{}, {}}

This is one of the simplifications that "gofmt -s" applies.

This analyzer ignores generated code.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [simplifycompositelit](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/simplifycompositelit)

<a id='simplifyrange'></a>
## `simplifyrange`: check for range statement simplifications


A range of the form:

	for x, _ = range v {...}

will be simplified to:

	for x = range v {...}

A range of the form:

	for _ = range v {...}

will be simplified to:

	for range v {...}

This is one of the simplifications that "gofmt -s" applies.

This analyzer ignores generated code.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [simplifyrange](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/simplifyrange)

<a id='simplifyslice'></a>
## `simplifyslice`: check for slice simplifications


A slice expression of the form:

	s[a:len(s)]

will be simplified to:

	s[a:]

This is one of the simplifications that "gofmt -s" applies.

This analyzer ignores generated code.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [simplifyslice](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/simplifyslice)

<a id='slog'></a>
## `slog`: check for invalid structured logging calls


The slog checker looks for calls to functions from the log/slog
package that take alternating key-value pairs. It reports calls
where an argument in a key position is neither a string nor a
slog.Attr, and where a final key is missing its value.
For example,it would report

	slog.Warn("message", 11, "k") // slog.Warn arg "11" should be a string or a slog.Attr

and

	slog.Info("message", "k1", v1, "k2") // call to slog.Info missing a final value

Default: on.

Package documentation: [slog](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/slog)

<a id='sortslice'></a>
## `sortslice`: check the argument type of sort.Slice


sort.Slice requires an argument of a slice type. Check that
the interface{} value passed to sort.Slice is actually a slice.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [sortslice](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/sortslice)

<a id='stdmethods'></a>
## `stdmethods`: check signature of methods of well-known interfaces


Sometimes a type may be intended to satisfy an interface but may fail to
do so because of a mistake in its method signature.
For example, the result of this WriteTo method should be (int64, error),
not error, to satisfy io.WriterTo:

	type myWriterTo struct{...}
	func (myWriterTo) WriteTo(w io.Writer) error { ... }

This check ensures that each method whose name matches one of several
well-known interface methods from the standard library has the correct
signature for that interface.

Checked method names include:

	Format GobEncode GobDecode MarshalJSON MarshalXML
	Peek ReadByte ReadFrom ReadRune Scan Seek
	UnmarshalJSON UnreadByte UnreadRune WriteByte
	WriteTo

Default: on.

Package documentation: [stdmethods](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/stdmethods)

<a id='stdversion'></a>
## `stdversion`: report uses of too-new standard library symbols


The stdversion analyzer reports references to symbols in the standard
library that were introduced by a Go release higher than the one in
force in the referring file. (Recall that the file's Go version is
defined by the 'go' directive its module's go.mod file, or by a
"//go:build go1.X" build tag at the top of the file.)

The analyzer does not report a diagnostic for a reference to a "too
new" field or method of a type that is itself "too new", as this may
have false positives, for example if fields or methods are accessed
through a type alias that is guarded by a Go version constraint.


Default: on.

Package documentation: [stdversion](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/stdversion)

<a id='stringintconv'></a>
## `stringintconv`: check for string(int) conversions


This checker flags conversions of the form string(x) where x is an integer
(but not byte or rune) type. Such conversions are discouraged because they
return the UTF-8 representation of the Unicode code point x, and not a decimal
string representation of x as one might expect. Furthermore, if x denotes an
invalid code point, the conversion cannot be statically rejected.

For conversions that intend on using the code point, consider replacing them
with string(rune(x)). Otherwise, strconv.Itoa and its equivalents return the
string representation of the value in the desired base.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [stringintconv](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/stringintconv)

<a id='structtag'></a>
## `structtag`: check that struct field tags conform to reflect.StructTag.Get


Also report certain struct tags (json, xml) used with unexported fields.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [structtag](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/structtag)

<a id='testinggoroutine'></a>
## `testinggoroutine`: report calls to (*testing.T).Fatal from goroutines started by a test


Functions that abruptly terminate a test, such as the Fatal, Fatalf, FailNow, and
Skip{,f,Now} methods of *testing.T, must be called from the test goroutine itself.
This checker detects calls to these functions that occur within a goroutine
started by the test. For example:

	func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
	    go func() {
	        t.Fatal("oops") // error: (*T).Fatal called from non-test goroutine
	    }()
	}

Default: on.

Package documentation: [testinggoroutine](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/testinggoroutine)

<a id='tests'></a>
## `tests`: check for common mistaken usages of tests and examples


The tests checker walks Test, Benchmark, Fuzzing and Example functions checking
malformed names, wrong signatures and examples documenting non-existent
identifiers.

Please see the documentation for package testing in golang.org/pkg/testing
for the conventions that are enforced for Tests, Benchmarks, and Examples.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [tests](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/tests)

<a id='timeformat'></a>
## `timeformat`: check for calls of (time.Time).Format or time.Parse with 2006-02-01


The timeformat checker looks for time formats with the 2006-02-01 (yyyy-dd-mm)
format. Internationally, "yyyy-dd-mm" does not occur in common calendar date
standards, and so it is more likely that 2006-01-02 (yyyy-mm-dd) was intended.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [timeformat](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/timeformat)

<a id='unmarshal'></a>
## `unmarshal`: report passing non-pointer or non-interface values to unmarshal


The unmarshal analysis reports calls to functions such as json.Unmarshal
in which the argument type is not a pointer or an interface.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unmarshal](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/unmarshal)

<a id='unreachable'></a>
## `unreachable`: check for unreachable code


The unreachable analyzer finds statements that execution can never reach
because they are preceded by a return statement, a call to panic, an
infinite loop, or similar constructs.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unreachable](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/unreachable)

<a id='unsafeptr'></a>
## `unsafeptr`: check for invalid conversions of uintptr to unsafe.Pointer


The unsafeptr analyzer reports likely incorrect uses of unsafe.Pointer
to convert integers to pointers. A conversion from uintptr to
unsafe.Pointer is invalid if it implies that there is a uintptr-typed
word in memory that holds a pointer value, because that word will be
invisible to stack copying and to the garbage collector.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unsafeptr](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/unsafeptr)

<a id='unusedfunc'></a>
## `unusedfunc`: check for unused functions, methods, etc


The unusedfunc analyzer reports functions and methods that are
never referenced outside of their own declaration.

A function is considered unused if it is unexported and not
referenced (except within its own declaration).

A method is considered unused if it is unexported, not referenced
(except within its own declaration), and its name does not match
that of any method of an interface type declared within the same
package.

The tool may report false positives in some situations, for
example:

  - For a declaration of an unexported function that is referenced
    from another package using the go:linkname mechanism, if the
    declaration's doc comment does not also have a go:linkname
    comment.

    (Such code is in any case strongly discouraged: linkname
    annotations, if they must be used at all, should be used on both
    the declaration and the alias.)

  - For compiler intrinsics in the "runtime" package that, though
    never referenced, are known to the compiler and are called
    indirectly by compiled object code.

  - For functions called only from assembly.

  - For functions called only from files whose build tags are not
    selected in the current build configuration.

See https://github.com/golang/go/issues/71686 for discussion of
these limitations.

The unusedfunc algorithm is not as precise as the
golang.org/x/tools/cmd/deadcode tool, but it has the advantage that
it runs within the modular analysis framework, enabling near
real-time feedback within gopls.

The unusedfunc analyzer also reports unused types, vars, and
constants. Enums--constants defined with iota--are ignored since
even the unused values must remain present to preserve the logical
ordering.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unusedfunc](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/unusedfunc)

<a id='unusedparams'></a>
## `unusedparams`: check for unused parameters of functions


The unusedparams analyzer checks functions to see if there are
any parameters that are not being used.

To ensure soundness, it ignores:
  - "address-taken" functions, that is, functions that are used as
    a value rather than being called directly; their signatures may
    be required to conform to a func type.
  - exported functions or methods, since they may be address-taken
    in another package.
  - unexported methods whose name matches an interface method
    declared in the same package, since the method's signature
    may be required to conform to the interface type.
  - functions with empty bodies, or containing just a call to panic.
  - parameters that are unnamed, or named "_", the blank identifier.

The analyzer suggests a fix of replacing the parameter name by "_",
but in such cases a deeper fix can be obtained by invoking the
"Refactor: remove unused parameter" code action, which will
eliminate the parameter entirely, along with all corresponding
arguments at call sites, while taking care to preserve any side
effects in the argument expressions; see
https://github.com/golang/tools/releases/tag/gopls%2Fv0.14.

This analyzer ignores generated code.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unusedparams](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/unusedparams)

<a id='unusedresult'></a>
## `unusedresult`: check for unused results of calls to some functions


Some functions like fmt.Errorf return a result and have no side
effects, so it is always a mistake to discard the result. Other
functions may return an error that must not be ignored, or a cleanup
operation that must be called. This analyzer reports calls to
functions like these when the result of the call is ignored.

The set of functions may be controlled using flags.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unusedresult](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/unusedresult)

<a id='unusedvariable'></a>
## `unusedvariable`: check for unused variables and suggest fixes



Default: on.

Package documentation: [unusedvariable](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/unusedvariable)

<a id='unusedwrite'></a>
## `unusedwrite`: checks for unused writes


The analyzer reports instances of writes to struct fields and
arrays that are never read. Specifically, when a struct object
or an array is copied, its elements are copied implicitly by
the compiler, and any element write to this copy does nothing
with the original object.

For example:

	type T struct { x int }

	func f(input []T) {
		for i, v := range input {  // v is a copy
			v.x = i  // unused write to field x
		}
	}

Another example is about non-pointer receiver:

	type T struct { x int }

	func (t T) f() {  // t is a copy
		t.x = i  // unused write to field x
	}

Default: on.

Package documentation: [unusedwrite](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/unusedwrite)

<a id='waitgroup'></a>
## `waitgroup`: check for misuses of sync.WaitGroup


This analyzer detects mistaken calls to the (*sync.WaitGroup).Add
method from inside a new goroutine, causing Add to race with Wait:

	// WRONG
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	go func() {
	        wg.Add(1) // "WaitGroup.Add called from inside new goroutine"
	        defer wg.Done()
	        ...
	}()
	wg.Wait() // (may return prematurely before new goroutine starts)

The correct code calls Add before starting the goroutine:

	// RIGHT
	var wg sync.WaitGroup
	wg.Add(1)
	go func() {
		defer wg.Done()
		...
	}()
	wg.Wait()

Default: on.

Package documentation: [waitgroup](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/go/analysis/passes/waitgroup)

<a id='yield'></a>
## `yield`: report calls to yield where the result is ignored


After a yield function returns false, the caller should not call
the yield function again; generally the iterator should return
promptly.

This example fails to check the result of the call to yield,
causing this analyzer to report a diagnostic:

	yield(1) // yield may be called again (on L2) after returning false
	yield(2)

The corrected code is either this:

	if yield(1) { yield(2) }

or simply:

	_ = yield(1) && yield(2)

It is not always a mistake to ignore the result of yield.
For example, this is a valid single-element iterator:

	yield(1) // ok to ignore result
	return

It is only a mistake when the yield call that returned false may be
followed by another call.

Default: on.

Package documentation: [yield](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/tools/gopls/internal/analysis/yield)
