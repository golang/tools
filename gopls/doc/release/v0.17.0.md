# Configuration Changes

The `fieldalignment` analyzer, previously disabled by default, has
been removed: it is redundant with the hover size/offset information
displayed by v0.16.0 and its diagnostics were confusing.

The kind (identifiers) of all of gopls' code actions have changed
to use more specific hierarchical names. For example, "Inline call"
has changed from `refactor.inline` to `refactor.inline.call`.
This allows clients to request particular code actions more precisely.
The user manual now includes the identifier in the documentation for each code action.

# New features

## Extract declarations to new file

Gopls now offers another code action,
"Extract declarations to new file" (`refactor.extract.toNewFile`),
which moves selected code sections to a newly created file within the
same package. The created filename is chosen as the first {function, type,
const, var} name encountered. In addition, import declarations are added or
removed as needed.

The user can invoke this code action by selecting a function name, the keywords
`func`, `const`, `var`, `type`, or by placing the caret on them without selecting,
or by selecting a whole declaration or multiple declrations.

In order to avoid ambiguity and surprise about what to extract, some kinds
of paritial selection of a declration cannot invoke this code action.

## Standard library version information in Hover

Hovering over a standard library symbol now displays information about the first
Go release containing the symbol. For example, hovering over `errors.As` shows
"Added in go1.13".

## Semantic token modifiers of top-level constructor of types
The semantic tokens response now includes additional modifiers for the top-level
constructor of the type of each symbol:
`interface`, `struct`, `signature`, `pointer`, `array`, `map`, `slice`, `chan`, `string`, `number`, `bool`, and `invalid`.
Editors may use this for syntax coloring.

## SignatureHelp for ident and values.

Now, function signature help can be used on any identifier with a function
signature, not just within the parentheses of a function being called.

## Jump to assembly definition

A Definition query on a reference to a function jumps to the
function's Go `func` declaration. If the function is implemented in C
or assembly, the function has no body. Executing a second Definition
query (while already at the Go declaration) will navigate you to the
assembly implementation.
