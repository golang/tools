# Configuration Changes

The `fieldalignment` analyzer, previously disabled by default, has
been removed: it is redundant with the hover size/offset information
displayed by v0.16.0 and its diagnostics were confusing.


# New features

## Extract declarations to new file
Gopls now offers another code action, "Extract declarations to new file",
which moves selected code sections to a newly created file within the
same package. The created filename is chosen as the first {function, type,
const, var} name encountered. In addition, import declarations are added or
removed as needed.

The user can invoke this code action by selecting a function name, the keywords
`func`, `const`, `var`, `type`, or by placing the caret on them without selecting,
or by selecting a whole declaration or multiple declrations.

In order to avoid ambiguity and surprise about what to extract, some kinds
of paritial selection of a declration cannot invoke this code action.

## Standard library version information in Hover

Hovering over a standard library symbol now displays information about the first
Go release containing the symbol. For example, hovering over `errors.As` shows
"Added in go1.13".
