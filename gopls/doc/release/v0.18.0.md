# Configuration Changes

- The experimental `hoverKind=Structured` setting is no longer supported.

# New features

## "Implementations" supports generics

At long last, the "Go to Implementations" feature now fully supports
generic types and functions (#59224).

For example, invoking the feature on the interface method `Stack.Push`
below will report the concrete method `C[T].Push`, and vice versa.

```go
package p

type Stack[T any] interface {
	Push(T) error
	Pop() (T, bool)
}

type C[T any] struct{}

func (C[T]) Push(t T) error { ... }
func (C[T]) Pop() (T, bool) { ... }

var _ Stack[int] = C[int]{}
```

## Extract all occurrences of the same expression under selection

When you have multiple instances of the same expression in a function,
you can use this code action to extract it into a variable.
All occurrences of the expression will be replaced with a reference to the new variable.

## Improvements to "Definition"

The Definition query now supports additional locations:

- When invoked on a return statement, it reports the location
  of the function's result variables.
