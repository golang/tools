# Configuration Changes

- The `gopls check` subcommant now accepts a `-severity` flag to set a minimum
  severity for the diagnostics it reports. By default, the minimum severity
  is "warning", so `gopls check` may report fewer diagnostics than before. Set
  `-severity=hint` to reproduce the previous behavior.

# New features

## "Eliminate dot import" code action

This code action, available on a dotted import, will offer to replace
the import with a regular one and qualify each use of the package
with its name.
