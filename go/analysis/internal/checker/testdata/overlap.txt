# This test exercises an edge case of merging.
#
# Two analyzers generate overlapping fixes for this package:
# - 'rename' changes "bar" to "baz"
# - 'marker' changes  "ar" to "baz"
# Historically this used to cause a conflict, but as it happens,
# the new merge algorithm splits the rename fix, since it overlaps
# the marker fix, into two subedits:
# - a deletion of "b" and
# - an edit from "ar" to "baz".
# The deletion is of course nonoverlapping, and the edit,
# by happy chance, is identical to the marker fix, so the two
# are coalesced.
#
# (This is a pretty unlikely situation, but it corresponds
# to a historical test, TestOther, that used to check for
# a conflict, and it seemed wrong to delete it without explanation.)
#
# The fixes are silently and successfully applied.
