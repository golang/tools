Pointer analysis to-do list
===========================

CONSTRAINT GENERATION:
- support reflection:
  - a couple of operators are missing
  - reflect.Values may contain lvalues (CanAddr)
- implement native intrinsics.  These vary by platform.
- unsafe.Pointer conversions.  Three options:
  1) unsoundly (but type-safely) treat p=unsafe.Pointer(x) conversions as
     allocations, losing aliases.  This is what's currently implemented.
  2) unsoundly (but type-safely) treat p=unsafe.Pointer(x) and T(p)
     conversions as interface boxing and unboxing operations.  
     This may preserve some aliasing relations at little cost.
  3) soundly track physical field offsets.  (Summarise dannyb's email here.)
     A downside is that we can't keep the identity field of struct
     allocations that identifies the object.    

OPTIMISATIONS
- pre-solver: PE via HVN/HRU and LE.
- solver: HCD, LCD.

MISC:
- Test on all platforms.  
  Currently we assume these go/build tags: linux, amd64, !cgo.
